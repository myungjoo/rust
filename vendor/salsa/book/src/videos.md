There are currently two videos about Salsa available:

- [How Salsa Works](https://youtu.be/_muY4HjSqVw), which gives a
  high-level introduction to the key concepts involved and shows how
  to use salsa;
- [Salsa In More Depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_IhACacPRY),
  which digs into the incremental algorithm and explains -- at a
  high-level -- how Salsa is implemented.
